Lensgo.AI Ambassador consists of five core components:

###  1. Competition Details  
A complete overview of the contest, including rules, deadlines, judging criteria, rewards, and participation guidelines.  
This section serves as the campaign’s foundation, helping users quickly understand how to join and what to expect.

###  2. Featured Works  
A curated gallery of outstanding submissions from past or current participants.  
Its purpose is to inspire creativity, demonstrate quality benchmarks, and motivate users to join the competition by showcasing real examples.

###  3. Teaser (Email Marketing)  
A pre-launch email designed to generate curiosity and anticipation.  
This message introduces the upcoming event, highlights rewards, and warms up the audience before the campaign officially starts.

###  4. Reminder (Email Marketing)  
A mid-campaign email sent to keep participants engaged and prevent drop-off.  
It typically reinforces deadlines, steps to participate, and includes examples from the “Featured Works” to encourage contribution.

###  5. Final Call (Email Marketing)  
A final push email sent during the last phase of the campaign to maximize conversions.  
It emphasizes remaining time, benefits of participating, and includes strong CTA messaging to prompt immediate action.
